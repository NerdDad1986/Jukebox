# Jukebox Project Shane O.
Created this jukebox to play a few songs that I enjoy. It is using the ATMEGA 1284 microcontroller, 16 pin LCD display, buttons, LED's and a piezo buzzer. Current version plays "Imperial March", "PACMan Theme" and "Zelda Theme". I do not own these songs, it is just for a hobby project.
